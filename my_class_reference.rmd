## Introduction

Consider this a personal guide to the commands and functions you will learn. In general, when you come across an R command or function that you want to remember, put it in here along with a description of what it does and when you'd use it.

### How to set the working directory

The command to set a working directory is setwd(). For example:

```{r}
setwd("~/code/data_journalism_2023_spring")
```

### How to install and load the tidyverse

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

### How to read in a CSV file from the Internet

```{r}
wes_moore_contributions <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephenneukam/CNS_Annapolis/main/Campaign_finance/Moore_ContributionsList.csv")
```

### How to count rows

You use the `n()` function to count rows, like so:

```{r}
dataframe %>% 
  group_by(some_column) %>% 
  summarize(count = n())
```
